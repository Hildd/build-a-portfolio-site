    He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and aquainted with grief; 
and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath born our

 for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chartisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
